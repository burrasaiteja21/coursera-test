- **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):** I learned how to structure web pages using HTML, creating headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and more. HTML provides the backbone of every web page.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** I acquired the skills to style web pages using CSS, including defining fonts, colors, layouts, and responsive design techniques. CSS allowed me to make web pages visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** The course introduced me to JavaScript, a powerful programming language for adding interactivity to web pages. I learned about variables, functions, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
- **Web Development Best Practices:** I gained insights into web development best practices, such as code organization, optimization, and browser compatibility. These skills are crucial for creating efficient and accessible websites.
- **Version Control with Git and GitHub:** I learned how to use Git for version control and GitHub for collaborative development. This knowledge helps me manage and share my code effectively.
By the end of the course, I could apply these skills to create web projects, implement interactive features, and understand modern web development principles. This repository showcases my assignments and projects, highlighting the practical experience I gained throughout the course.

I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in starting a career in web development or looking to enhance their front-end development skills. It's a valuable resource for mastering the fundamentals of web development and creating dynamic, user-friendly websites.
